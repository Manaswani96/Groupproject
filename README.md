The Sustainable Aquaculture Platform is an innovative web-based solution designed to promote transparency, traceability, and ethical practices in aquaculture. With the rising demand for sustainable food sources, this platform aims to empower small-scale fish farmers and ensure buyers have access to reliable information about their fishâ€™s journey, from farm to table.

Through real-time tracking and blockchain-verified supply chains, the platform highlights the importance of sustainability, reduces environmental impact, and builds trust between producers and consumers.
